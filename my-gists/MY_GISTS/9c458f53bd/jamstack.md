## The problem with the legacy web

### Complex apps and complex servers

A traditional website is actually a program that has to run on a web server at all times.

Running sites this way needlessly slows things down, provides way too many opportunities for attack, and is expensive to scale.

## What the Jamstack delivers

    ### Faster websites

    Optimize your site with prerendering and global delivery.

    ### More secure infrastructure

    By design, Jamstack architectures offer fewer points of attack.

    ### High scale without high complexity

    Optimize your site with prerendering and global delivery.

    ### Improved developer experience

    Launch faster with more productive dev & deployment cycles.

## How it works

1.  ### Decoupling the frontend from the backend

    Unlike the large legacy apps, Jamstack projects neatly separate the frontend pages and UI from the backend apps and databases. Freed from backend servers, the frontend can then be deployed globally, directly to a CDN.

2.  ### Prebuilding all pages for speed

    Before deployment, the entire frontend is prebuilt into highly optimized static pages and assets. This happens in a build process (before being deployed / hosted).

3.  ### Dynamic content via APIs

    The global frontend uses Javascript and APIs to talk to backend services, allowing pages to be enhanced and personalized.

## How it advances the web

- ### Running sites on web servers replaced by deploying sites globally

  RUNNING SITES ON WEB SERVERS![](https://cdn.netlify.com/0c5d39f8e41fa2a94312aee2f7c8f64669016c81/ab677/img/jamstack/running-sites-on-webservers.svg)replaced by![](https://cdn.netlify.com/03eb6f4c81b70f43035a3ac11f1e9239108fa5c4/eb643/img/jamstack/deploying-sites-globally.svg)DEPLOYING SITES GLOBALLY

  A Jamstack deployment doesn't run on a traditional setup of origin servers. Instead, automated deployments are used to push sites directly to the Edge / CDN.

- ### Webpages rendered at runtime replaced by webpages prerendered for speed

  Rather than building content at runtime for each request, content is prebuilt and optimized during a build setup using a site generator and other build tools.

- ### Monolithic applications replaced by APIs & microservices

  Decoupling the frontend from the backend allows for more modular development where we can take advantage of the huge ecosystem of third party tools to provide website functionality.
