In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to use Gatsby themes by creating a new site using the official Gatsby blog theme.

[](#pre-requisites)Pre-requisites
---------------------------------

*   A Gatsby site

> Note: This tutorial assumes you already have a Gatsby site to install your theme in. If you’d prefer to start with an entirely new site you can run `gatsby new my-blog https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog-theme` to set up a starter with the blog theme already installed.

[](#installing-the-blog-theme)Installing the blog theme
-------------------------------------------------------

Navigate to the root of your project inside your terminal and install the theme with the following command:

    npm install gatsby-theme-blog

[](#configure-the-theme)Configure the theme
-------------------------------------------

In your `gatsby-config.js` file, add `gatsby-theme-blog`. This theme takes optional dependencies that you can find in the [README](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/themes/tree/master/packages/gatsby-theme-blog#theme-options). However, you won’t need to use them here.

    module.exports = {  plugins: [    {      resolve: "gatsby-theme-blog",      options: {},    },  ],}

> Note: If you already have a landing page set up for your site, you may want to make use of the `basePath` option that will put your blog listing page at a path other than `/`, such as `/blog`.

Customize the information on your site by replacing the site metadata in the `gatsby-config.js` file. Your `siteUrl` should point to your public domain. It’s ok if you don’t have one yet, you can update it later.

    module.exports = {  siteMetadata: {    title: "My Blog",    author: "Amberley Romo",    description: "A collection of my thoughts and writings.",    siteUrl: "https://amberley.blog/",    social: [      {        name: "twitter",        url: "https://twitter.com/amber1ey",      },      {        name: "github",        url: "https://github.com/amberleyromo",      },    ],  },  plugins: [    {      resolve: "gatsby-theme-blog",      options: {},    },  ],}

[](#add-some-content)Add some content
-------------------------------------

Before you can see anything, you’ll want to add some content so there is something to show.

By default, the posts are expected in the `/content/posts` directory, so create those folders and add a `my-post.md` file. Your file structure should look something like this.

    my-blog├── content│   └── posts│       └── my-post.md├── src├── gatsby-config.js└── package.json

Despite the `md` extension, `my-post.md` is treated as an MDX file. When using this theme, you can use `md` and `mdx` extensions interchangeably.

Inside that Markdown file, add content. The top section is called [frontmatter](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/docs/how-to/routing/mdx/writing-pages/#using-frontmatter-in-mdx) and `title` and `date` are required fields.

/content/posts/my-post.md

    ---title: My Postdate: 2020-04-15---Let's write a post!```javascriptconst test = "this is a theme"```

[](#test-run-your-site)Test run your site
-----------------------------------------

To make sure everything is working, run your site. This command should be run in your terminal in your project’s root directory.

Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to see the landing page of your site.

[](#replace-your-avatar)Replace your avatar
-------------------------------------------

At the moment, the bio on your pages shows a blank section where a picture should be. Add your own avatar by choosing the image you want, and overwriting the file located at `/content/assets/avatar.png`.

[](#replace-the-content-of-the-bio)Replace the content of the bio
-----------------------------------------------------------------

When using Gatsby themes, you can take advantage of something called component shadowing. This allows you to override the default component included in the theme with a custom one you’ve created.

The Gatsby blog theme package has a component that contains the content of the site author’s biography. The file path to that component (in the blog theme package, not your site) is `src/gatsby-theme-blog/components/bio-content.js`. You can find this path by looking through the theme in your site’s `node_modules/gatsby-theme-blog` directory.

If you look at the file tree of your site, you’ll see it looks something like this:

    my-blog├── content│   ├── assets│   │   └── avatar.png│   └── posts│       └── my-post.md├── src│   └── gatsby-theme-blog│       └── components│           └── bio-content.js├── gatsby-config.js└── package.json

In the `src` directory of the site, there’s a `gatsby-theme-blog` directory. Any file placed in that directory with a path that matches the path of a file in the blog theme directory will completely shadow the theme.

> 💡 The name of the directory (here `gatsby-theme-blog`) must exactly mirror the name of the published theme package, which in this case is [`gatsby-theme-blog`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-theme-blog).

Open up the `bio-content.js` file and make some content edits:

    import React, { Fragment } from "react"export default function Bio() {  return (    <Fragment>      This is my updated bio.      <br />      It's shadowing the content from the theme.    </Fragment>  )}

At this point, you should have an updated avatar, updated site details, and an updated bio. You may want to re-run `gatsby develop` to make sure everything looks good.

[](#change-the-color-theme)Change the color theme
-------------------------------------------------

The blog theme uses `gatsby-plugin-theme-ui` to style your site. There are a number of presets available for you to make use of, or you can make your own!

> If you want to use a preset take a look at the [Theme UI preset listing](https://theme-ui.com/packages/presets).

You’re going to use `@theme-ui/preset-funk`. To start, you have to install it.

    npm install @theme-ui/preset-funk

Next, update your `gatsby-config.js` file to pass in the preset package name.

    module.exports = {  plugins: [    {      resolve: "gatsby-theme-blog",      options: {        preset: "@theme-ui/preset-funk",      },    },  ],}

If you want to further customize this theme you can shadow it. Create a file at `/src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js`.

/src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js

    const darkBlue = `#007acc`const lightBlue = `#66E0FF`const blueGray = `#282c35`export default {  colors: {    text: blueGray,    primary: darkBlue,    heading: blueGray,  },}

These colors will merge with the preset theme and override that part of the preset.

### [](#change-your-prism-theme)Change your prism theme

Another option you can make use of is prism styling for code blocks. There are many available from [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/packages/prism#syntax-themes).

In this example you’ll use `prism-okaidia`. Update your `gatsby-config.js` file with that option.

    module.exports = {  plugins: [    {      resolve: "gatsby-theme-blog",      options: {        preset: "@theme-ui/preset-funk",        prismPreset: "prism-okaidia",      },    },  ],}

When you restart your development server you’ll see new syntax highlighting in your code snippets.

[](#take-a-look)Take a look
---------------------------

Fire up your development server by running `gatsby develop` again in your terminal. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` and take a look at your blog listing page.

[](#wrapping-up)Wrapping up
---------------------------

This was a step-by-step introduction to using a Gatsby theme through looking at a specific example. Note that different themes will be built differently, to accept different customization options. To dive deeper, check out the [Gatsby Theme docs](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/docs/themes/).
