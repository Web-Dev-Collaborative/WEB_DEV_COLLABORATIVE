                <p>You will install three pieces of software so that you can start using PostgreSQL. You will install
                  PostgreSQL itself on your Windows installation. Then, you will install <code>psql</code> in your
                  Ubuntu installation. Then you will also install Postbird, a cross-platform graphical user interface
                  that makes working with SQL and PostgreSQL better than just using the command line tool
                  <code>psql</code>.</p>
                <p>When you read "installation", that means the actual OS that's running on your machine. So, you have a
                  Windows installation, Windows 10, that's running when you boot your computer. Then, when you start the
                  Ubuntu installation, it's as if there's a completely separate computer running inside your computer.
                  It's like having two completely different laptops.</p>
                <h2>Installing PostgreSQL 12</h2>
                <p>To install PostgreSQL 12, you need to download the installer from the Internet. PostgreSQL's
                  commercial company, Enterprise DB, offers installers for PostgreSQL for every major platform.</p>

                <h2>Installing PostgreSQL Client Tools on Ubuntu</h2>
                <p>Now, to install the PostgreSQL Client tools for Ubuntu. You need to do this so that the Node.js (and
                  later Python) programs running on your Ubuntu installation can access the PostgreSQL server running on
                  your Windows installation. You need to tell <code>apt</code>, the package manager, that you want it to
                  go find the PostgreSQL 12 client tools from PostgreSQL itself rather than the common package
                  repositories. You do that by issuing the following two commands. Copy and paste them one at a time
                  into your shell. (If your Ubuntu shell isn't running, start one.)</p>
                <p><strong>Pro-tip</strong>: Copy those commands because you're not going to type them, right? After you
                  copy one of them, you can just right-click on the Ubuntu shell. That should paste them in there for
                  you.</p>
                <pre><code>wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -
</code></pre>
                <p>If prompted for your password, type it.</p>
                <pre><code>echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ `lsb_release -cs`-pgdg main" | sudo tee  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list
</code></pre>
                <p>The last line of output of those two commands running should read "OK". If it does not, try copying
                  and pasting them one at a time.</p>
                <p>Now that you've registered the PostgreSQL repositories as a source to look for PostgreSQL, you need
                  to update the <code>apt</code> registry. You should do this before you install <em>any</em> software
                  on Ubuntu.</p>
                <pre><code>sudo apt update
</code></pre>
                <p>Once that's finished running, the new entries for PostgreSQL 12 should be in the repository. Now, you
                  can install them with the following command.</p>
                <pre><code>sudo apt install postgresql-client-12 postgresql-common
</code></pre>
                <p>If it asks you if you want to install them, please tell it "Y".</p>
                <p>Test that it installed by typing <code>psql --version</code>. You should see it print out information
                  about the version of the installed tools. If it tells you that it can't find the command, try these
                  instructions over.</p>
                <h2>Configuring the client tools</h2>
                <p>Since you're going to be accessing the PosgreSQL installation from your Ubuntu installation on your
                  Windows installation, you're going to have to type that you want to access it over and over, which
                  means extra typing. To prevent you from having to do this, you can customize your shell to always add
                  the extra commands for you.</p>
                <p>This assumes you're still using Bash. If you changed the shell that your Ubuntu installation uses,
                  please follow that shell's directions for adding an alias to its startup file.</p>
                <p>Make sure you're in your Ubuntu home directory. You can do that by typing <code>cd</code> and hitting
                  enter. Use <code>ls</code> to find out if you have a <code>.bashrc</code> file. Type <code>ls
                    .bashrc</code>. If it shows you that one exists, that's the one you will add the alias to. If it
                  tells you that there is no file named that, then type <code>ls .profile</code>. If it shows you that
                  one exists, that's the one you will add the alias to. If it shows you that it does not exist, then use
                  the file name <code>.bashrc</code> in the following section.</p>
                <p>Now that you know which profile file to use, type <code>code «profile file name»</code> where
                  "profile file name" is the name of the file you determined from the last section. Once Visual Studio
                  Code starts up with your file, at the end of it (or if you've already added aliases, in that section),
                  type the following.</p>
                <pre><code>alias psql="psql -h localhost"
</code></pre>
                <p>When you run <code>psql</code> from the command line, it will now always add the part about wanting
                  to connect to <em>localhost</em> every time. You would have to type that each time, otherwise.</p>
                <p>To make sure that you set that up correctly, type <code>psql -U postgres postgres</code>. This tells
                  the <code>psql</code> client that you want to connect as the user "postgres" (<code>-U
                    postgres</code>) to the database postgres (<code>postgres</code> at the end), which is the default
                  database created when PostgreSQL is installed. It will prompt you for a password. Type the password
                  that you used when you installed PostgrSQL, earlier. If the alias works correctly and you type the
                  correct password, then you should see something like the following output.</p>
                <pre><code>psql (12.2 (Ubuntu 12.2-2.pgdg18.04+1))
Type "help" for help.

postgres=#
</code></pre>
                <p>Type <code>\q</code> and hit Enter to exit the PostgreSQL client tool.</p>
                <p>Now, you will add a user for your Ubuntu identity so that you don't have to specify it all the time.
                  Then, you will create a file that PostgreSQL will use to automatically send your password every time.
                </p>
                <p>Copy and paste the following into your Ubuntu shell. Think of a password that you want to use for
                  your user. <strong>Replace the password in the single quotes in the command with the password that you
                    want.</strong> It <em>has</em> to be a non-empty string. PostgreSQL doesn't like it when it's not.
                </p>
                <pre><code>psql -U postgres -c "CREATE USER `whoami` WITH PASSWORD 'password' SUPERUSER"
</code></pre>
                <p>It should prompt you for a password. Type the password that you created when you installed
                  PostgreSQL. Once you type the correct password, you should see "CREATE ROLE".</p>
                <p>Now you will create your PostgreSQL password file. Type the following into your Ubuntu shell to open
                  Visual Studio Code and create a new file.</p>
                <pre><code>code ~/.pgpass
</code></pre>
                <p>In that file, you will add this line, which tells it that on localhost for port 5432 (where
                  PostgreSQL is running), for all databases (*), <strong>use your Ubuntu user name and the password that
                    you just created for that user with the <code>psql</code> command you just typed.</strong> (If you
                  have forgotten your Ubuntu user name, type <code>whoami</code> on the command line.) Your entry in the
                  file should have this format.</p>
                <pre><code>localhost:5432:*:«your Ubuntu user name»:«the password you just used»
</code></pre>
                <p>For the curriculum writers' systems, it looks like this in Visual Studio Code.</p>

                <p>Once you have that information in the file, save it, and close Visual Studio Code.</p>
                <p>The last step you have to take is change the permission on that file so that it is only readable by
                  your user. PostgreSQL will ignore it if just anyone can read and write to it. This is for
                  <em>your</em> security. Change the file permissions so only you can read and write to it. You did this
                  once upon a time. Here's the command.</p>
                <pre><code>chmod go-rw ~/.pgpass
</code></pre>
                <p>You can confirm that only you have read/write permission by typing <code>ls -al ~/.pgpass</code>.
                  That should return output that looks like this, <strong>with your Ubuntu user name instead of
                    "appacademy".</strong></p>
                <pre><code>-rw------- 1 appacademy appacademy 37 Mar 28 21:20 /home/appacademy/.pgpass
</code></pre>
                <p>Now, try connecting to PostreSQL by typing <code>psql postgres</code>. Because you added the alias to
                  your startup script, and because you created your <strong>.pgpass</strong> file, it should now connect
                  without prompting you for any credentials! Type <code>\q</code> and press Enter to exit the PostgreSQL
                  command line client.</p>
                <h2>Installing Postbird</h2>
                <p>Head over to the <a href="https://github.com/Paxa/postbird/releases">Postbird releases page on
                    GitHub</a>. Click the installer for Windows which you can recognize because it's the only file in

                <p>After that installer downloads, run it. You will get a warning from Windows that this is from an

                  trust and install it or do everything from the command line.</p>
