              <p>broowserools reserves the right, at any time, to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services and/or
                any
                part or parts thereof with or without notice. You agree that broowserools will not be liable to you or

              <h2>11. Claims of Copyright Infringement</h2>

              <p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who
                believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. It is
                our policy to respond to notices and counter-notices that properly conform with the DMCA's requirements.
                Accordingly, notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by
                the DMCA; see the Copyright Office's web page at www.copyright.gov for details of the current DMCA
                requirements.</p>

              <p>If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by broowserools infringe your copyright (for
                example,
                materials posted by a user on one of our message boards), you (or your agent) may send us a written
                notification pursuant to the DMCA, by providing our DMCA Agent with the information listed below (and as
                further set forth in 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3)) and requesting that the material be removed or access to it
                blocked:</p>

              <p>Identification in sufficient detail of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed. If
                multiple copyrighted works on the Services are covered by a single notification, you may provide a
                representative list of such works on the Services, however, the representative list must still contain
                sufficient detail of the copyrighted works so that we can identify them;</p>

              <p>Identification of the URL or other specific location on the Services that contains the material that
                you claim to be infringing your copyright. You must provide us with reasonably sufficient information to
                enable us to locate the alleged infringing material(s), so that we can comply with your request to
                remove or deny access to it/them;</p>

              <p>Your name, address, telephone number and email address (if available);</p>

              <p>The electronic or physical signature of the owner of the copyright or a person authorized to act on the
                owner's behalf;</p>

              <p>A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is
                not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</p>

              <p>A statement that you swear under penalty of perjury that the information contained in your notification
                is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or that you are authorized to act on behalf of the
                owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</p>

              <p>You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this Section, your DMCA
                notice will not be valid. You must submit any notification of an alleged copyright infringement to
                broowserools's DMCA Agent by email at support@broowserools.com.</p>

              <h2>12. Termination</h2>

              <p>Your right to access and use the Services, will remain effective until terminated in accordance with
                the Terms of Use. broowserools reserves the right to revoke the limited license granted to you herein
                for
                any reason or no reason, and, if we do, broowserools may terminate your access to and use of the
                Services, and may, in its sole discretion maintain or delete your Account.</p>

              <p>broowserools may suspend, terminate, modify, or delete your Account with or without notice to you, at
                any time for any reason or for no reason, including without limitation, for violation or suspected
                violation of the Terms of Use. For example, your Account may be deleted and terminated without warning
                if broowserools believes, in its sole discretion, that you are under 18 years of age; if you provide any
                information that is untrue, inaccurate (or becomes untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete); or
                broowserools has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current
                or incomplete. Upon termination, your right to access and use the Services or Customer Data, will
                immediately cease. In addition to its termination rights, broowserools also reserves the right to refuse
                service to anyone and to remove content, Submissions or Customer Data for any reason whatsoever in its
                sole discretion.</p>

              <p>The Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California,
                United States of America, without regards to its principles of conflicts of law that would require the
                application of the laws of another jurisdiction. Any disputes between you and broowserools relating to
                the Services or the Customer Data, and including the Services available on or through any Third Party
                Platform, that involve a claim of less than $5,000 must be resolved exclusively through binding
                non-appearance-based arbitration. A party electing arbitration shall initiate proceedings by filing an
                arbitration demand with the American Arbitration Association (AAA). The arbitration proceedings shall be
                governed by the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules, Consumer Due Process Protocol, and Supplementary
                Procedures for Resolution of Consumer-Related Disputes. In addition, you and broowserools agree that the

                the option of the party seeking relief, by telephone, online, or based solely on written submissions;
                (b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless
                otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator
                may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Any disputes between you and broowserools that
                involve a claim of more than $5,000 are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal and State
                courts located in San Francisco, California.</p>

              <h2>18. Notices</h2>

              <p>All notices required or permitted to be given under this Agreement must be in writing and shall be
                given by personal delivery, registered or certified mail, or Federal Express or other nationally

                Agent with the State of California, and if to you, to the e-mail and/or postal address associated with
                your Account. Notices, if personally delivered, shall be deemed to have been received on the date of
                delivery; if by registered or certified mail, on the third business day after mailing; if by Federal
                Express or e-mail, on the second business day after deposit with the service. You may not send any
                notices under this Section to broowserools via e-mail.</p>

              <h2>19. Miscellaneous</h2>

              <p>If any provision of the Terms of Use is found to be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable,
                then that provision shall be deemed severable from the Terms of Use and shall not affect the validity
                and enforceability of any remaining provisions. The Terms of Use are not assignable, transferable or
                sublicensable by you except with broowserools's prior written consent. No waiver by either party of any
                breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or
                default. Any heading, caption or section title contained herein is inserted only as a matter of
                convenience and in no way defines or explains any section or provision hereof. broowserools's
                performance
                of the Terms of Use is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in the Terms of
                Use is in derogation of broowserools's right to comply with governmental, court, and law enforcement
                requests or requirements relating to your access and/or use of the Services or the Customer Data and
                including the Services available on or through any Third Party Platform, or information provided to or
                gathered by broowserools with respect to such access and/or use. A printed version of the Terms of Use
                and of any notices given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative
                proceedings based upon or relating to the Terms of Use to the same extent and subject to the same
                conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.
                The parties agree that all correspondence relating to these Terms of Use, must be written in the English
                language.</p>
