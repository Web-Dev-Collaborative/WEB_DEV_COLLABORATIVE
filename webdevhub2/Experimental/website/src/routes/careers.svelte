      Make software engineering collaborative and joyful again.
    </h2>
    <p class="text-2xl">
      Developers write software within languages/frameworks, build tools, glue
      them together to (tool) chains, develop against APIs and communicate and
      collaborate with our colleagues. All of that should be efficient, joyful
      and secure.
    </p>
    <p class="text-2xl">
      Yet it is not. Devs constantly struggle with larger codebases, cluttered
      dependencies, security policies and unnecessary friction in their
      workflows.
    </p>
    <p class="text-2xl">
      We want to make developers feel again that everything is at their
      fingertips.
    </p>
    <h2 class="h4 mt-5rem">
      Gitpod was founded because we were frustrated by manually setting up and
      maintaining dev environments.
    </h2>
    <p class="text-2xl">
      We are building Gitpod in the open to easily spin-up fresh dev
      environments for any task. Those ephemeral environments are fast &
      powerful, fully automated & initialized. They empower developers to
      immediately start coding, debugging, and testing their code.
    </p>
    <p class="text-2xl">Only then developers are always ready-to-code.</p>
    <h2 class="h4 mt-5rem">
      The company was established in 2020 and today over 350,000 devs
      gitpodified their workflows.
    </h2>
    <p class="text-2xl">
      We are greateful to be backed by some of the best venture firms and
      advisors of the world. We recently announced a 13m funding round.
    </p>
    <p class="text-2xl">
      Come join a quickly growing venture-backed team and work together with
      incredible humans from four continents 🌍
    </p>
    <p class="text-2xl">
      We are open minded, transparent and curious. We remain students of the
      game, not masters of the game.
    </p>
    <p class="text-2xl">
      We aim for a frictionless experience when interacting with our product,
      our company and our brand: no hurdles, no BS, no unnecessary extra steps.
    </p>
    <p class="text-2xl">
      We are fully-distributed. You can work from anywhere and schedule your
      working hours the way it fits best for you. We make sure you are all set
      and will treat you well.

    <p class="text-2xl font-bold">
      We are not as diverse as we would like to be.

    <p class="text-2xl">
      Help us to change that and shape Gitpod’s future from anywhere in the
