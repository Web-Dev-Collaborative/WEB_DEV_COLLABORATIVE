  I like to share and I think it is important, so when it was possible, I added my contribute in the platforms that I followed. The time was my limit. So I did not be constant but only consistent: I always tryed to finish that I started or I passed to whoever would have finished it. In this section I listed my public projects.

  The only common thread was sharing and teaching that I know: before helping guys with homeworks and teaching at the swimming pool, after teaching at the University and sharing topics, matters and cases. The business world is a bit different from the academic one, but I kept this common thread and now there are small puzzles that also come together within the company: Pixartprinting is an hub of hash code competition!

  The flagship are my non profit projects, because they are the merge of my passions for our children and guys.
