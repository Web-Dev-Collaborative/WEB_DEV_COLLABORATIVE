Use your knowledge of both flexbox and CSS Grid, you can finish the layout for
all 10 areas of the main grid. Each section below contains the specifications
for you to finish it. You should be pretty familiar with the content of the
HTML file, now. For each of the sections below, you will be dealing with the
CSS class `.grid__section-«number»` where «number» is 4, 5, 6, etc.
