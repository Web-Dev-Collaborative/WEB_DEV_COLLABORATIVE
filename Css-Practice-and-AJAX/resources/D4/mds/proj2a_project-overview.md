# Gridding Up A Page: Overview

________________________________________________________________________________

CSS Grid is a powerful tool that gives us a lot of control over the layout of a
Web page. With the Grid, we no longer have to import external CSS libraries or
frameworks for layout. We can set up and fully customize a grid layout with
vanilla CSS.

There’s no better way to practice page layout than by going back to where it all
began -- the newspaper! Printed papers have been painstakingly laid out with
considerations of both limited space and limited attention spans. Some of these
layout and design principles have persisted from print to the Web -- for
examples, the term “above-the-fold” (above the literal page fold in print, and
the visible part of the screen before scrolling down online) and the concept of
CSS floats from text-wrapped images.

In this project, you’ll use CSS Grid to re-create THE LAYOUT ONLY of the columns
and rows of the overall structure, and then the layout inside each of the
sections of the layout. We’ve chosen to emulate the layout of the _The New York
Times_ for this project because the homepage is a complex series of rows and
columns, and it’s a prime use-case for a grid layout.

The project is broken up into three phases.

* In Phase 1, you'll create the main grid with 10 key sections of the page.
* In Phase 2, you'll use flexbox inside Section 1.
* In Phase 3, you'll create nested grids in Section 2 and Section 3.
* In Phase 4, you'll create the grids in the remainder of the Sections.

Clone the starter project found at
https://github.com/appacademy-starters/css-grid-nytimes. Inside that project,
you will find the following files.

* **grid-project.html** which contains the HTML that you will style using Grid
  layout
* **grid-project.css** which contains some basic CSS for the page and in which
  you will write your CSS
* **nyt-logo.svg** which contains the New York Times' logo.

Refer to your reading and resources like [“CSS Grid Layout”][1] (MDN Docs) or [
“A Complete Guide to Grid”][2] (CSS-Tricks) for guidance on setting up the grid
for your project.

When you are done, you will have a Web page similar to what you see in this
rather large screenshot.
